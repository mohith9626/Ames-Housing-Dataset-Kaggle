# Ames-Housing-Dataset-Kaggle
Prediction using Machine Learning Models


With the Ames Housing Dataset got from the Kaggle handcrafted a scoring function to estimate the Most Desirable 
and the Least Desirable Houses in the Data using the variables given in the Dataset. By using
Machine Learning Models like Linear Regression, Light GBM, XGBoost made predictions on the Sales Price of the 
Houses in the Ames Housing Dataset. Did clustering and Multiple Analysis on the Dataset.
